# Centroids from Martin Hieronymi by his ONNS algorithm in 2017
# The values here are first log-transformed and then area-normalized (the second column)
# lgRrs = log10(Rrs + 1); ` + 1` is used to avoid some negative input (failure by atmospheric correction) while the spectral shape is still good
# norm_lgRrs = lgRrs / trapz(lgRrs)
# Update Mar-18 2022
