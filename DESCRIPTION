Description: Functions provide an improved Fuzzy Clustering Method (FCMm) for optical classification
    of inland waters remote sensing (Bi et al, 2019) <doi:10.1364/OE.27.034838>. Users can 
    train their own high dimensional spectra data to obtain centroids or apply 
    the built-in centroids to new data from inland water systems. The package supports the Chla 
    concentration estimation through published algorithms and finally to return the blending 
    results by assigning optimized algorithm results to specific water types. Spectra plot by
    the package 'ggplot2', application to image data by the package 'raster', and other practical
    remote sensing tools are also supported!
